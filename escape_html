# To disable escaping, set this to '0', to enable set to '1'.

# Flavours to perform escaping on: defaults to 'rss'.
# You can change the value and add more using the '|' character
# as a separator, e.g.: $flavour = 'rss1|rss2';
my $flavours = 'rss';

=head1 NAME

Blosxom plugin: escape_html

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin allows you to control whether or not you escape HTML in the $body and $title of your posts.

As distributed, blosxom will escape HTML in each post's $title and $body if it detects an XML content-type, so for this plugin to be useful you first have to disable this section of code, lines 378-384 in the original blosxom 2 script.  Simply commenting out these lines has the desired effect.

By default, this plugin will escape the HTML when the flavour is 'rss'; this is to mirror the default behaviour of blosxom as closely as possible.  You can configure which flavours will trigger the escaping with the variable B<$escape_html::flavours> or disable escaping altogther with the variable B<$escape_html::escape>.
